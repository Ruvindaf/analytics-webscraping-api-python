# Exploring Web Analytics via Python ‚Äì API, Scraping, and Forecasting Practice

This project is a hands-on exercise designed to showcase various data analytics techniques using Python. It focuses on real-world data sourcing methods such as web scraping and API integration, along with data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and forecasting models. The datasets used are based on real data sources; however, the forecasts and insights generated in this project are purely educational and should not be used for making real-world decisions. The primary aim is to demonstrate proficiency in Python for data-driven problem solving.
